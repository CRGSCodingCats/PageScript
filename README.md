## How to Use PageScript

1. **Write Your Markup**  
   Create a plain text file with a `.pagescript` extension and use simple syntax:
   ```
   # Hello, World!

   This is a *friendly* and **easy** way to build web pages.

   ```

2. **Run the Converter**  
   Use the provided Python script to convert your `.pagescript` file to HTML in the Command Prompt / Windows PowerShell:
   ```
   python converter.py myfile.pagescript
   ```

3. **Open the Output**  
   The converter will generate a `myfile.html` in the same directory. Open it in any web browser to see your page in action.

4. **Customize and Expand**  
   Tweak your PageScript, re-run the converter, and build beautiful pages without writing raw HTML.
